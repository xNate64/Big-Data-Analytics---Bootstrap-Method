# Big-Data-Analytics---Bootstrap-Method

# This project was from STA4724 - Big Data Analytics. In this assignment, the bootstrap method was applied on Boston Housing data, specifically the median value of homes sold in that area. The standard error of the sample mean was taken to compare with the answer gotten from the bootstrap. The bootstrap method was also used to find the standard error of the sample median and the 10th percentile of the data.
